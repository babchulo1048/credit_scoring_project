Credit Scoring App

A machine learning-based credit scoring application built with Python, Random Forest, SHAP, and Streamlit. This project predicts the probability of loan default, converts it to a credit score (300–900), and provides feature importance explanations using SHAP. The app allows users to input applicant details and view real-time predictions through a Streamlit interface.

Overview

This project demonstrates a credit scoring system that evaluates loan applicants based on features like age, job, housing, and credit amount. It uses a Random Forest model trained with SMOTE to handle class imbalance, and SHAP for explainability. The Streamlit app provides an interactive interface to input applicant data and view predictions, including risk probability, credit score, decision, and key factors influencing the outcome.
Features

Prediction: Estimates the probability of loan default using a Random Forest model.

Credit Score: Maps risk probability to a 300–900 score (lower score = higher risk).

Decision Logic: Approves or rejects applicants based on score thresholds:

800–900: Excellent (Approve)
700–799: Good (Approve)
600–699: Fair (Maybe)
500–599: Poor (Caution)
300–499: Very Poor (Reject)


Explainability: Uses SHAP to highlight top factors (e.g., Savings_accounts, Duration).

Interactive UI: Streamlit app for user-friendly input and visualization.

Deployment: Supports local or cloud deployment with ngrok for public access.

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-scoring-demo.git
cd credit-scoring-demo


Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt


Add the dataset (credit_scoring_data.csv) to the data/ folder. (Note: Not included in the repository due to size; source it separately or contact the maintainer.)
(Optional) Regenerate model.pkl and shap_explainer.pkl by running the notebook in notebooks/.

Usage

Run the Streamlit app locally:streamlit run app/app.py


Open the provided URL (e.g., http://localhost:8501) in your browser.
Enter applicant details (e.g., Age, Sex, Credit_amount) in the Streamlit interface.
Click "Predict" to view:
Risk Probability (e.g., 72%)
Credit Score (e.g., 432)
Decision (e.g., Reject)
Top Factors (e.g., Saving_accounts, Duration, Checking_account)
SHAP bar plot for feature importance



Example Input and Output
Input:
{
    "Age": 32,
    "Sex": "male",
    "Job": "skilled",
    "Housing": "rent",
    "Saving_accounts": "little",
    "Checking_account": "moderate",
    "Credit_amount": 3000,
    "Duration": 24,
    "Purpose": "car"
}

Output:
{
    "Risk_Probability": 0.72,
    "Credit_Score": 432,
    "Decision": "Reject",
    "Top_Factors": ["Saving_accounts", "Duration", "Checking_account"]
}

Deployment

Local: Run streamlit run app/app.py for local access.
Cloud (Google Colab): Use pyngrok to create a public URL:
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the provided notebook in notebooks/ to set up ngrok and launch the app.
Access the public URL generated by ngrok.


Note: For stable ngrok tunnels, obtain a free authtoken from ngrok.com and set it in your environment.
